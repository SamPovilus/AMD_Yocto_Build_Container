note, this file contanins my username because I was too lazy to fix it

Also note that I use a conda enviroment to get python 3.11 as this container seems to get it's base environment from somewhere with 3.13 (as of when i type this im runing debian testing which has 3.13 which eliminated support for `pipes` the python module and ninja 1.11.1 requires pipes)
